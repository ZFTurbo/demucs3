# Training (Hybrid) Demucs

## Install all the dependencies

You should install all the dependencies either with either Anaconda (using the env file `environment-cuda.yml` )
or `pip`, with `requirements.txt`.

## Datasets

### MusDB HQ

Note that we do not support MusDB non HQ training anymore.
Get the [Musdb HQ](https://zenodo.org/record/3338373) dataset, and update the path to it in two places:
- The `dset.musdb` key inside `conf/config.yaml`.
- The variable `MUSDB_PATH` inside `tools/automix.py`.

### Create the fine tuning datasets

I use a fine tuning on a dataset crafted by remixing songs in a musically plausible way.
The automix script will make sure that BPM, first beat and pitches are aligned.
In the file `tools/automix.py`, edit `OUTPATH` to suit your setup, as well as the `MUSDB_PATH`
to point to your copy of MusDB HQ. Then run

```bash
python3 -m tools.automix
```

Finally, edit the file `conf/dset/auto_mus.yaml` and replace `dset.wav` to the value of `OUTPATH`.

If you have a custom dataset, you can also uncomment the lines `dset2 = ...` and
`dset3 = ...` to add your custom wav data and the test set of MusDB for Track B models.
You can then replace the paths in `conf/dset/auto_extra.yaml`, `conf/dset/auto_extra_test.yaml`
and `conf/dset/aetl.yaml` (this last one was using 10 mixes instead of 6 for each song).

### Dataset metadata cache

Datasets are scanned the first time they are used to determine the files and their durations.
If you change a dataset and need a rescan, just delete the `metadata` folder.

## A short intro to Dora

I use [Dora][dora] for all the of experiments (XPs) management. You should have a look at the Dora README
to learn about the tool. Here is a quick summary of what to know:

- An XP is a unique set of hyper-parameters with a given signature. The signature is a hash of
    those hyper-parameters. I will always refer to an XP with its signature, e.g. `9357e12e`.
    We will see after that you can retrieve the hyper-params and re-rerun it in a single command.
- In fact, the hash is defined as a delta between the base config and the one obtained with
    the config overrides you passed from the command line.
    **This means you must never change the `conf/**.yaml` files directly.**,
    except for editing things like paths. Changing the default values in the config files means
    the XP signature won't reflect that change, and wrong checkpoints might be reused.
    I know, this is annoying, but the reason is that otherwise, any change to the config file would
    mean that all XPs ran so far would see their signature change.

### Dora commands

Run `tar xvf outputs.tar.gz`. This will initialize the Dora XP repository, so that Dora knows
which hyper-params match the signature like `9357e12e`. Once you have done that, you should be able
to run the following:

```bash
dora info -f 81de367c  # this will show the hyper-parameter used by a specific XP.
                       # Be careful some overrides might present twice, and the right most one
                       # will give you the right value for it.
dora run -d -f 81de367c   # run an XP with the hyper-parameters from XP 81de367c.
                          # `-d` is for distributed, it will use all available GPUs.
dora run -d -f 81de367c hdemucs.channels=32  # start from the config of XP 81de367c but change some hyper-params.
                                             # This will give you a new XP with a new signature (here 3fe9c332).
```

An XP runs from a specific folder based on its signature, by default under the `outputs/` folder.
You can safely interrupt a training and resume it, it will reuse any existing checkpoint, as it will
reuse the same folder.
If you made some change to the code and need to ignore a previous checkpoint you can use `dora run --clear [RUN ARGS]`.

If you have a Slurm cluster, you can also use the `dora grid` command, e.g. `dora grid mdx`.
Please refer to the [Dora documentation][dora] for more information.

## Hyper parameters

Have a look at [conf/config.yaml](../conf/config.yaml) for a list of all the hyper-parameters you can override.
If you are not familiar with [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra), go checkout their page
to be familiar with how to provide overrides for your trainings.

### Storing config in files

As mentioned earlier, you should never change the base config files. However, you can use Hydra config groups
in order to store variants you often use. If you want to create a new variant combining multiple hyper-params,
copy the file `conf/variant/example.yaml` to `conf/variant/my_variant.yaml`, and then you can use it with

```bash
dora train -d variant=my_variant
```

Once you have created this file, you should not edit it once you have started training models with it.


## Fine tuning

If a first model is trained, you can fine tune it with other settings (e.g. automix dataset) with

```bash
dora run -d -f 81de367c continue_from=81de367c dset=auto_mus variant=finetune
````

Note that you need both `-f 81de367c` and `continue_from=81de367c`. The first one indicates
that the hyper-params of `81de367c` should be used as a starting point for the config.
The second indicates that the weights from `81de367c` should be used as a starting point for the solver.


## Model evaluation

Your model will be evaluated automatically with the new SDR definition from MDX every 20 epochs.
Old style SDR (which is quite slow) will only happen at the end of training.

## Model Export


In order to use your models with other commands (such as the `demucs` command for separation) you must
export it. For that run

```bash
python3 -m tools.export 9357e12e [OTHER SIGS ...]  # replace with the appropriate signatures.
```

The models will be stored under `release_models/`. You can use them with the `demucs` separation command with the following flags:
```bash
demucs --repo ./release_models -n 9357e12e my_track.mp3
```

### Bag of models

If you want to combine multiple models, potentially with different weights for each source, you can copy
`demucs/remote/mdx.yaml` to `./release_models/my_bag.yaml`. You can then edit the list of models (all models used should have been exported first) and the weights per source and model (list of list, outer list is over models, inner list is over sources). You can then use your bag of model as

```bash
demucs --repo ./release_models -n my_bag my_track.mp3
```

You can also evaluate your bag of model with the following command:
```bash
python3 -m tools.test_pretrained --repo ./release_models -n my_bag
```

## Model Zoo

Here is a short descriptions of the models used for the MDX submission, either Track A (MusDB HQ only)
or Track B (extra training data allowed). Training happen in two stage, with the second stage
being the fine tunining on the automix generated dataset.
All the fine tuned models are available on our AWS repository
(you can retrieve it with `demucs.pretrained.get_model(SIG)`).

### Track A

The 4 models are:

- `0d19c1c6`: fine-tuned on automix dataset from `9357e12e`
- `7ecf8ec1`: fine-tuned on automix dataset from `e312f349`
- `c511e2ab`: fine-tuned on automix dataset from `81de367c`
- `7d865c68`: fine-tuned on automix dataset from `80a68df8`

The 4 initial models (before fine tuning are):

- `9357e12e`: 64ch time domain only improved Demucs, with new residual branches, group norm,
  and singular value penalty.
- `e312f349`: 64ch time domain only improved, with new residual branches, group norm,
  and singular value penalty, trained with a loss that focus only on drums and bass.
- `81de367c`: 48ch hybrid model , with residual branches, group norm,
  singular value penalty penalty and Wiener filtering.
- `80a68df8`: same as b5559babb but using CaC instead of Wiener filtering and different
  random seed, as well different weigths per frequency bands in outermost layers.

The hybrid models are combined with equal weights for all sources except for the bass.
`0d19c1c6` (time domain) is used for both drums and bass. `7ecf8ec1` is used only for the bass.

### Track B

- `e51eebcc`
- `a1d90b5c`
- `5d2d6c55`
- `cfa93e08`

All the models are 48ch hybrid demucs with different random seeds. Two of them
are using CaC, and two of them are using Wiener filtering.
All the models are combined with equal weights for all sources.

Things are a bit messy for Track B, there was a lot of fine tuning
over different datasets. I won't describe the entire genealogy of models here,
but all the information can be accessed with the `dora info -f SIG` command.
